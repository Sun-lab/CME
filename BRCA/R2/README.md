# R code and associated Rout files 

* R_batch1 and R_batch2
	+ codes for the first round of analysis. 

* R_batch3
	+ codes from Wei Sun with two major updates. 
		1. apply normal quantile transformation on gene expression and DNA methylation data
		2. only use those DNA methylation probes after filtering by SNPs 
		
* R_batch4
	+ follow up analysis using data from R_batch3 to summarize results and prepare figures for paper
