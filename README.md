# CME: Copy number aberration, DNA Methylation, and gene Expression
 
 This repository provide some example code for our analysis to study the association between copy number aberration, DNA methylation and gene expression in tumor samples. One of the most important conclusions is that the vast majority of the association between gene expression and DNA methylation in tumor tissues is due to confounding factors of tumor purity and cell type composition. We develop a simple PCA based approach to account for such latent factors while do not directly estimate them. 
 
The code in folder BRCA are our code to analyze the data from TCGA breast cancer. Because some data have restricted access, though they are publicly available from NCI GDC after application, we only share the code here.
